For my new position at the USZ as data modeller, I want to have a site where I can organise the learning material that I am digesting for this position. I want to follow [Chi Zhang's](https://andreaczhang.github.io/) set-up with Quarto and see where that takes me.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

# In a quarto website, I can also present code and calculations, e.g.:
1 + 1
```
